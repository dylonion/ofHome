        Because our programs provide young people and moms with funding and personalized
        assistance over a period long enough to allow significant sustainable change, it is not
        every day that we have a graduate. Below are just a few of our graduates.
        <strong>We could not be more proud of all of them!</strong>

            My brother and I were put into foster care because my mother
            wasn’t able to continue her motherly duties for different reasons.

              my aunt was to take care of my brother and I who lived in New York.
              Things didn’t pan out well for us all so my brother and I were put back
              into foster care. While at Good Shepherds, I was blessed to be able to apply
              for OHFF during my sophomore year.  OHFF invested in my college career to the end.
              With the scholarship came a funny and loving mentor whose name is Jennifer!
              My mentor and OHFF also, showed a great deal of care which I felt I was lacking,
              especially during my college career.  This continued a connection even after attending
              my graduation which was a joyous day for all! On May 12, 2012, I graduated from Virginia
              Union University with a double major in Entrepreneurial Management and Marketing.
