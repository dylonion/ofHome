        Domestic Violence Survivors
        + Students
      </h3>
      <p>
        Studies have shown that children who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to
        abuse their own partners and children in the future. Your donation means that women
        who are overcoming abuse can receive counseling, financial support, and job training so
        that their children will have a brighter future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our students are chosen because they have the drive to succeed. We know that social
        guidance and financial support for these students will go a long way. Your donation can
        help change a life.
