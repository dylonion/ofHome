      <h3>I was given a new lease on life</h3>
      <p>
        OHFF was a significant part of my rescue from a very difficult and
        challenging existence. I was at a point where I knew that I needed
        something to give me reason to hope once again, as my confidence and
        self-worth were dangerously low. As a victim of domestic abuse who ...

      <h3>It turned out to be something greater than I ever imagined</h3>
      <p>
        The best thing that came from my involvement with Nancy and Rob did not
        have to do with finances. The idea of a mentor for me was very different
        than what they provided. In my placement, mentors were faceless individuals
        of wealth who would come around sparingly to go out for a meal. Nancy and
        Rob were committed individuals who were dedicated to me and my needs and
        gave me the most valuable commitment anyone has ever given me...their time.
        It’s irreplaceable. I cannot thank them enough for their commitment and what they
        are striving to achieve with the charity.

      <h3>Because of OHFF I was able to pick up the pieces</h3>
      <p>
        After enduring the hardship of domestic violence, my family and I were
        scarred and scared. It was a difficult journey with many challenges and
        struggles, but without OHFF my life would not be the same. My daughter
        is now doing well as a college freshman. My son is adjusting and advancing well in school, ...

      <h3>We recommend this to those that want to make a difference</h3>
      <p>
        Not knowing what to expect, we started mentoring at OHFF five years ago.
        Little did we know that it would be such a rewarding experience! Our
        mentee has grown so much in these few years–both socially and educationally.
        He’s become a wonderful and very responsible young man and accomplished things
        that ...

      <h3>Truly unique</h3>
      <p>
        I lost a friend to domestic violence many years ago. One reason she
        didn’t leave with her young daughter was because she couldn’t figure out
        how to bridge that period after leaving the shelter and before achieving
        financial independence. I began volunteering with OHFF because ...
