        <h3>100%: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</h3>
        <article>
          From the start, we decided that every donation should go straight to the people in our
          programs. We’re serious when we say 100%. A group of private donors pays for
          everything including the PayPal and credit card transaction fees we incur anytime you
          donate online. This is to ensure that every single dollar you give goes straight to the
          people we help.

        <h3>GIVING: HOW DO I DONATE?</h3>
        <article>
          <section>
            <h3>ONLINE:</h3>
            <p>
              Donating online is our easiest option. You can donate using any major credit card. All
              international donations made on the Of Home, Family and Future website will be
              converted to USD. Take care when filling out billing and shipping information; PayPal
              has a highly sensitive automatic fraud alert system, and it picks up any inconsistencies
              in these subjects.
            </p>
            <p>There are different options for giving online. <a href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>/donate/">See them here</a>.</p>
            <p>
              Security for online donations: We use PayPal, the largest online global payment
              processor, to securely process all online donations. Don’t worry; you don’t need an
              account with them to donate to Of Home, Family and Future. And we’ll never share
              your information with anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Only donations from within the U.S. are tax-deductible. For USD money orders, please

            <h3>MONEY ORDERS:</h3>
            <p>
              Should be made payable to Of Home, Family and Future. At this time, we don’t accept
              foreign checks; however, international banks can and will make checks out in USD for
              you, if you go in and ask. You can then mail us that check, using our address listed above.

            <h3>TAX-DEDUCTIBILITY:</h3>
            <p>
              Of Home, Family and Future is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, so all donations made
              directly to the organization are tax-deductible. Our audited financials as well as our
              501(c)(3) exemption can be found online <a href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>/financials/">here</a>. Our 501(c)(3) document may not be
              provided to any sponsors or donors on our behalf without our written consent. If
              you’re looking for our 990 information, please email <a href="mailto:info@ofhome.org">info@ofhome.org</a>

            <h3>TAX RECEIPTS:</h3>
            <p>
              Receipts for online donations may take up to 24 hours to process and email to you. Be
              on the lookout for yours; tax receipt emails sometimes find their way into junk mail
              folders. If you don’t get your receipt within 12 hours, please let us know and we’ll gladly
              reissue you another one. Offline donors receive a formal tax receipt in the mail within
              four weeks after their donation has been processed. Again, if you don’t get your receipt
              within that time, just let us know and we’ll resend it.
