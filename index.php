        <h3>Educational Mentoring Program</h3>
        <p>
          The reality is only 2-11% of foster kids earn
          a bachelor’s degree. At 21, they age out of
          the system and many of them face college without
          financial or emotional help. We step in to
          provide well-rounded support so they can
          graduate and look forward to bright,
          productive futures.

        <h3>Domestic Violence Initiative</h3>
        <p>
          10 million children witness domestic violence
          annually. Many women who experience this
          abuse don’t report it and have difficulty
          moving on. Our Domestic Violence Initiative
          provides comprehensive support so they can
          build stable and economically viable families.
