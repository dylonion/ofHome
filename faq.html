        <h3>100%: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</h3>
        <article>
          From the start, we decided that every donation should go straight to the people in our
          program. We’re serious when we say 100%. A group of private donors pays for
          everything including the PayPal and credit card transaction fees we incur anytime you
          donate online. This is to ensure that every single dollar you give goes straight to the
          people we help.
