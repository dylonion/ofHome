        We know that for people with the
        desire to succeed, providing
        comprehensive support can create
        lasting change. That’s why we’ve
        developed our Educational Mentoring
        Program and Domestic Violence
        Initiative. Your support helps us make
        a difference in their lives.

        <h3>Educational Mentoring Program</h3>
        <p>
          The reality is only 2-11% of foster kids earn
          a bachelor’s degree. At 21, they age out of
          the system and many of them face college without
          financial or emotional help. We step in to
          provide well-rounded support so they can
          graduate and look forward to bright,
          productive futures.

        <h3>Domestic Violence Initiative</h3>
        <p>
          10 million children witness domestic violence
          annually. Many women who experience this
          abuse don’t report it and have difficulty
          moving on. Our Domestic Violence Initiative
          provides comprehensive support so they can
          build stable and economically viable families.
