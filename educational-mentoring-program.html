        Our Educational Mentoring Program (EMP) helps students from the foster care system
        achieve their goal of completing college. Many of these students drop out of college
        because they don’t feel comfortable in their environment, not because they’re
        intellectually unable to do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMP focuses on students who possess the strength of character and intellectual tools to
        break the cycle of poverty, drugs, and despair, but are often lost to society due to lack of
        appropriate support. In cooperation with partner agencies, this program provides vital
        support to enable these students to become college graduates and contributors to
        society.

      <h1>Mentors are absolutely vital to EMP!</h1>
      <p>
        Each student is paired with an adult who volunteers to establish and maintain a
        consistent, caring relationship with the student and remain with that student for up to 5
        years, as long as the student remains in college. The mentor helps the student to
        understand the college environment, offers emotional support, and provides guidance on
        school and personal issues as well as spending decisions. The mentor works closely with
        us and our partner agencies. We are always looking for qualified mentors. If you are
        interested in learning more about becoming a mentor, please contact us.
