        Our Domestic Violence Initiative (DVI) provides comprehensive support to women
        survivors of domestic violence and their children. The mothers are
        given access to the resources they need in order to build strong, economically
        independent families, empowering them to make significant and lasting changes in their
        lives and those of their children.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2014, we launched The Harry and Carol Goodman Transformation2 Program in
        collaboration with Sanctuary for Families, one of our partner agencies. By combining our
        strengths with Sanctuary, we can help more families achieve these goals over a shorter,
        more concentrated program period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sanctuary sponsors these women and puts them through their successful 4 month
        Economic Empowerment Program, where they learn basic 21st century skills needed to
        get a job. For an additional 11 months, we become their sponsor and help them focus
        on professional development in fields they are interested in and have the potential to be
        successful. Of Home, Family and Future solely funds and manages the grants during that
        period. We enable these working mothers to gain a more advanced entry point in a
        career which can lead to real economic independence. In addition to skills training, we
        provide these mothers the “extra” support needed to allow the transformation including:
        cell phones, computers, budgeting, credit counseling, and stipends for child care.
