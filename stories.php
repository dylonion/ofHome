        Because our programs provide young people and moms with funding and personalized
        assistance over a period long enough to allow significant sustainable change, it is not
        every day that we have a graduate. Below are just a few of our graduates.
        <strong>We could not be more proud of all of them!</strong>

            My brother and I were put into foster care because my mother
            wasn’t able to continue her motherly duties for different reasons.

              My brother and I were put into foster care because my mother
              wasn’t able to continue her motherly duties for different reasons.
              In the event that anything were to happen, my aunt was to take care of my brother and I who lived in New York.  Things didn’t pan out well for us all
              so my brother and I were put back into foster care. While at Good Shepherds, I was blessed to be able to
              apply for OHFF during my sophomore year.  OHFF invested in my college career to the end.  With the scholarship
              came a funny and loving mentor whose name is Jennifer!  My mentor and OHFF also, showed a great deal of
              care which I felt I was lacking, especially during my college career.  This continued a connection even
              after attending my graduation which was a joyous day for all! On May 12, 2012, I graduated from Virginia
              Union University with a double major in Entrepreneurial Management and Marketing.

              But those are the people who change the world, aren’t they? We learned a great deal from him during his time
              in the Educational Mentoring Program, and the program is better for it. Now that he has completed this stage
              of his journey, we know the world will be his oyster.

          <h3>MIRZA</h3>
          <p>
            Originally from Central America, Mirza joined our Educational Mentoring Program in the summer of 2010.
            She wrote, prior to joining the program, “Many people have judged me based on what I’ve been through and
            they have told me that I won’t make it far in life<span class="elipse">...</span>

              Originally from Central America, Mirza joined our Educational Mentoring Program in the summer of 2010.
              She wrote, prior to joining the program, “Many people have judged me based on what I’ve been through and
              they have told me that I won’t make it far in life...I’m one of those people that believe that there is an
              American Dream…but opportunities won’t come to you, you have to go out there and look for them….I know that by
              continuing my education I can reach my own American Dream…maybe also help other people reach theirs.”
              She had a solid plan and a good relationship with her mentors. And she managed
              to secure employment in the midst of this crazy job market. Mirza is smart, responsible, thoughtful, proactive
              and brave. In May of 2013, she received her degree in Psychology from a 4 year NY state university.
              In her own words, “…I’m dedicating my degree to you guys, without you this would not have been possible.
              I will forever be thankful for all you’ve done, it truly means the world to me.”

          <h3>MARCUS</h3>
          <p>
            When you hear the term “two-timer”, it automatically conjures up a
            negative connotation. But in this case, we mean it as a compliment! <span class="elipse">...</span>

              When you hear the term “two-timer”, it automatically conjures up a
              negative connotation. But in this case, we mean it as a compliment!
              We launched our Educational Mentoring Program for the 2006/7 academic year with Marcus (not his real name) as
              one of our first two students. He received his Associates degree from FIT in the spring of 2009 and graduated
              from our program. Then, he continued working toward his Bachelors degree in Horticulture at a 4 year school
              and came BACK into the EMP to finish out his term. This young man came into the program having faced numerous
              challenges before and during his time in the foster care system. His personal growth was inspiring to witness,
              he did well academically and his career path looked promising. Marcus graduated from OHFF’s Educational Mentoring
              Program in August of 2012. Not only has he been steadily employed in his field of study since he graduated with
              his degree in May of 2012, but recently his boss and his boss’ supervisor approached him saying they want him
              to pursue a Masters Degree in his field, AND told him that his employer will pay for it! He plans to take them
              up on their offer. What a wonderful opportunity, and what a worthy recipient. We are so excited for his future.

          <p>
            Anthony, one of our students, was blinded as a result of gun violence a few years ago. Recently,
            two individuals created a powerful video about Anthony, including an interview with William,
            his mentor. It is definitely worth watching!  Click on link to watch video.  <a href="https://vimeo.com/66360477">https://vimeo.com/66360477</a>
