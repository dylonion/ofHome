        Let me start out by saying that I have never
        been through the “system.” I didn’t grow up
        as a foster kid nor did I suffer from
        domestic violence. Yet, I have spent my
        entire professional life surrounded by
        teenagers in foster care and women who
        have suffered abuse.

        I grew up observing various forms of abuse and though I wouldn’t have admitted it then, I
        probably studied psychology at college because of it. I received my Ph.D. in 1986 and, a
        few years later, I found myself volunteering at a shelter for domestic violence survivors.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was at this shelter that Of Home, Family and Future began to form – at least in my
        mind. I witnessed first-hand the suffering that women went through when they realized
        they had nowhere to go after they were obliged to leave the shelter. With no place to
        turn, they often returned to their abusers and the cycle went around and around. I, also,
        became aware of a significant group of women who fell between the cracks,
        economically, in that they earned too much to qualify for government support and too
        little to adequately provide for their family. These woman had such difficulty moving on,
        no matter how motivated they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        After considerable research, my husband Rob and I developed a proposal for a program
        designed to provide comprehensive support to a small number of highly motivated,
        employed, women survivors of domestic violence in order to help them transform their
        lives. This proposal was accepted by a major charity, and the domestic violence
        program,“Of Home and Family”, was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        During that time, Rob and I began mentoring a 17 year old young man from a residential
        treatment facility, who had applied to college. We became acutely aware of the incredible
        roadblocks he faced as he was embarking on the college experience and the roadblocks
        that continued to appear as he worked his way through college. The foster care system
        automatically kicked students out of care as soon as they turn 21. How does a college
        student with nowhere to turn (no foster home and no support) manage to continue
        college in such a situation?
      </p>
      <p>
        As we dealt with the challenges of forming a relationship with a young man from the
        foster care system in terms of trust issues, life skill issues, dealing with the institution
        where he was living, and as we began to witness his growth, we thought about helping
        other young people in his situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004, we parted ways with the major charity that had supported “Of Home and
        Family”. With the help of energetic, generous friends who volunteered to serve as Board
        Directors and Officers, we formed our own non-profit, “Of Home, Family and Future”,
        and, in addition to the Domestic Violence Initiative, developed an Educational
        Mentoring Program focusing on a small number of foster care students who have been
        accepted to college.
      </p>
      <p>
        In July 2008, we decided to focus on the charity full-time. Our goal is to provide
        comprehensive support to these individuals. We hope to help them develop the tools
        they need to become successful members of society so that they can lead happy,
        productive lives and maybe even mentor other individuals who have suffered from
        similar experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re a small charity, and we do most of the work ourselves so that 100% of your
        donations can go straight to these individuals. We’re dedicating the rest of our lives to
        changing the world, one person at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As little as $25 can help us do that. Please donate.
